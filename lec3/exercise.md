Write a single C++ program that does the following:

1. Input two integers from the user â†’ `a` and `b`.
2. Perform and print results of:
   - Arithmetic operators: a+b, a-b, a\*b, a/b, a%b
   - Relational operators: Compare a and b (>, <, ==, !=)
   - Logical operators: Check if both are positive, at least one is positive, and if a is not positive
   - Assignment operators: Start with c=a and apply +=, -=, \*=, /=. Print c after each
   - Increment/Decrement: Show a++ vs ++a, b-- vs --b
   - Precedence: Evaluate a + b \* 2 and (a + b) \* 2
   - Associativity: Evaluate a - b - 2 and a / b / 2
