# Lab – Data Types, Input/Output, and Operators

### Task 1 – Basic Types & I/O

1. Declare variables of type int, float, double, char, and bool.
2. Take input for each variable from the user using cin.
3. Print them back using cout.

Example (student should expand for all types):
int age;
cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;
cout << "Your age is: " << age << endl;

### Task 2 – Arithmetic Operators

1. Take two integers from the user.
2. Perform and print results of:
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (\*)
   - Division (/)
   - Modulus (%)

Example output:
Enter two numbers: 10 3
10 + 3 = 13
10 - 3 = 7
10 \* 3 = 30
10 / 3 = 3
10 % 3 = 1

### Task 3 – Relational Operators

1. Take two numbers as input.
2. Compare them using:
   - >
   - <
   - > =
   - <=
   - ==
   - !=
3. Print results as true or false.

Example output:
Enter two numbers: 5 8
5 > 8 : 0
5 < 8 : 1
5 == 8 : 0

### Task 4 – Logical Operators

1. Take two bool inputs (0 or 1).
2. Show results of:
   - Logical AND (&&)
   - Logical OR (||)
   - Logical NOT (!)

Example output:
Enter two boolean values (0 or 1): 1 0
a && b = 0
a || b = 1
!a = 0
!b = 1

### Task 5 – Mini Calculator

Write a program that:

1. Asks user for two numbers.
2. Asks user for an operator (+ - \* / %).
3. Uses if or switch to perform the operation.
4. Prints the result.

Example run:
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 4
Enter operator (+, -, _, /, %): _
Result: 48

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Students get comfortable with types (int, float, double, char, bool).
- They learn console I/O (cin, cout).
- They practice arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
- They build a mini-project (calculator) combining all concepts.
