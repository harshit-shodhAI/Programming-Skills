Write a program that:

1. Find First Multiple (break)

   - Take an integer n as input.
   - Loop from 1 to 100 and print the first number that is divisible by n.
   - Stop the loop immediately after finding it.

2. Skip Multiples (continue)

   - Take two integers, m and k, as input.
   - Loop from 1 to m and print all numbers except those divisible by k.
   - Use continue to skip the multiples of k.

3. Pattern A – Inverted Right Triangle

```
   ****
   ***
   **
   *
```

- Number of rows should be taken from the user.

4. Pattern B – Number Triangle

```
   1
   12
   123
   1234
```

- Number of rows should be taken from the user.
