Write a program that:

1. Prints numbers from 1 to 20 using a **for loop**.

2. Prints numbers from 20 down to 1 using a **while loop**.

3. Reads an integer `n` and prints the multiplication table of `n` using a **for loop**.

4. Reads an integer `n` and prints the multiplication table of `n` in reverse order (from 10 down to 1) using a **while loop**.

5. Reads an integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number using a **for loop**.

6. Reads an integer `n` and prints all even numbers from 1 to `n` using a **while loop**.

7. Reads an integer `n` and calculates the factorial of `n` using a **do-while loop**.

8. Reads numbers from the user until the user enters `0`. Use a **do-while loop** to ensure the user is asked at least once.

9. Demonstrates the three forms of the **for loop**:
   - Without initialization (initialize before loop)
   - Without condition (use `break` to exit)
   - Without increment (increment inside loop body)
